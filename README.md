# Bank-Loan-Default-Prediction

This project aims to tackle the day-to-day challenge faced by financial institutions, which is loan payment default. My team and I implemented 3 machine learning models
that can be used as a  reference tool to predict if a person will default on a loan payment based on credit score and other information provided by them. 
These models will help financial institutions to make the decision on whether to issue the loan or not so that the risk can be minimized and at the same 
time profit can be maximized.
